# racket-invaders
Space Invaders in Racket (for learning purposes)

This is the final project from the [edX "How to Code: Simple Data" course](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+HtC1x+2T2017/home):
a simple implementation of Space Invaders in Racket.

The start-up code was provided by the course and completed solely by me.
