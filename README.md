# racket-invaders
Space Invaders in Racket (for learning purposes)

This is the final project from the [edX "How to Code: Simple Data" course](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+HtC1x+2T2017/home):
a simple implementation of Space Invaders in Racket.

The start-up code was provided by the course and completed solely by me.

Probably the best way to execute the code is with
[Dr. Racket](https://racket-lang.org/); execute the *definitions* in the source
code (presented in the *definitions area* with *Racket -> Run*  (Ctrl-R in
Windows), and then type `(main G0)` in the interactions area below the code
window.
